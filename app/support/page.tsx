        <b>What is gender exploratory therapy?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gender exploratory therapy simply means that your therapist doesn't rush
        to affirm your identity, and instead helps you explore why you might
        feel this way. Gender activists hate this idea because it conflicts with
        their belief that gender (a social construct) is something innate within
        us, and the idea that people can be 'born in the wrong body'.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you google gender exploratory therapy, you will find all sorts of
        articles and studies by gender activists who compare it to gay
        conversion therapy. For example the study{" "}

        . Studies in this field by people who currently identify as trans should
        be treated with skepticism, as they are motivated to protect the
        validity of their identity.
        <p>
          The notion that gender exploratory therapy is evil and wrong is
          predicated on the idea that gender is something innate within us, but
          the mere existence of detrans people causes this theory to fall over
          immediatly. Gender activists then fall back to saying that detrans
          people were never 'real trans' people, but detrans experiences tell us
          that they were fully 'in it', until they weren't any more.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also noteworthy that scientists are still yet to discover a 'gay
          gene', and that many people who self-identified as gay or straight at
          one point also come to the realisation that sexuality is not as black
          and white as society once told them it is.
