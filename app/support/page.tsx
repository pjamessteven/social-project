        <b>What is gender exploratory therapy?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gender exploratory therapy simply means that your therapist doesn't rush
        to affirm your identity, and instead helps you explore why you might
        feel this way. Gender activists hate this idea because it conflicts with
        their belief that gender (a social construct) is something innate within
        us, and the belief that people who experience gender dysphoria are 'born
        in the wrong body'.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you Google "gender exploratory therapy", you will find all sorts of
        articles and studies published by gender activists who compare it to gay
        conversion therapy and paint it in a very negative light. The truth is
        that gender identity is completely diffferent from sexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research in this field is often biased. The study{" "}

          Interrogating Gender-Exploratory Therapy

        . Studies in this field by people who currently identify as trans should
        be treated with skepticism, as they are motivated to protect the
        validity of their identity.
        <p>
          The notion that gender exploratory therapy is somehow evil and wrong
          is predicated on the idea that gender is something innate within us,
          but there is no evidence to support this belief, and the mere
          existence of detrans people causes this theory to fall over
          immediatly. Gender activists then fall back to saying that detrans
          people were never 'real trans' people, but detrans people tell us that
          they really were believers and fully 'in it', until they weren't any
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's also noteworthy that scientists are still yet to discover a 'gay
          gene', and that many people who self-identified as gay or straight at
          one point come to a realisation that sexuality is not as black and
          white as society once told them it is. Love knows no bounds.

        </a>{" "}
        is one of the only online directories for gender exploratory therapists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therapy First membership is open to professionals in the mental health
        field who are in agreement with the values of the organization as
        outlined below.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          People who are experiencing distress regarding gender or biological
          sex should have access to ethical, developmentally appropriate
          psychotherapy.
        </li>

        <li>
          We reject treatments that set out to change sexual orientation or
          gender identity. Practices that use coercive techniques have no place
          in health care.
        </li>

        <li>
          We respect client autonomy and do not impose our own beliefs, values,
          opinions, ideology, religion, or goals on clients. Conflating
          exploration of gender identity with "conversion therapy" betrays a
          misunderstanding of the basic principles of psychotherapy.
        </li>

        <li>
          Psychological approaches should be the first-line treatment for gender
          dysphoria. Psychological interventions avoid the risks of social and
          medical transition, and support client autonomy by facilitating deeper
          self-understanding.
        </li>

        <li>
          Given the lack of long-term, peer-reviewed, longitudinal evidence and
          the risk of regret, medical interventions for gender dysphoria in
          children and teens are experimental and should be avoided if possible.
        </li>

        <li>
          We hold a developmental understanding of gender dysphoria and see it
          as arising in a context. The assumption that gender is an innate
          quality of the individual is unhelpful as it ignores the multiple
          factors that may be contributing to the individual's distress.
          Overlooking these issues can deprive individuals of comprehensive
          psychological care.
        </li>

        <li>
          We recognize that behavior, feelings, and beliefs, including those
          related to gender identity, are influenced by factors of which we may
          not be fully conscious. The exploration of unconscious factors is not
          inherently pathologizing. Rather, its purpose is to expand and deepen
          self-understanding.
        </li>

        <li>
          Psychotherapy provides an individualized process to clients who wish
          to deepen their own self-understanding with therapists who apply
          established, evidence-based, ethical principles of therapy to
          individuals experiencing gender-related distress.
        </li>

        <li>
          Adult clients retain the right to bodily autonomy and the role of
          psychotherapy is to create a space where the client can deepen their
          understanding of gender dysphoria in the broader scope of their lives.
        </li>

        <li>
          Beginning medical interventions does not preclude an individual from
          the benefits of psychotherapy, which can offer meaningful support and
          exploration during the complex and dynamic process of transition.
        </li>

        <li>
          The gender affirmation model of therapy is outdated and inadequate.
          Gender-affirmative therapies can fail to consider the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Gender and sexuality are complex, develop over time, and are
              influenced by many factors (biological, psychological, social,
              etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              The significant medical, psychological, and social risks and
              unknowns associated with transition (both social and
              medical/surgical) require honest examination.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal identity is not static. Identity exploration is a normal
              part of adolescent and young adult development.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is extremely difficult to determine if a gender identity
              experienced during childhood and adolescence will remain fixed
              into adulthood. Because identity remains in flux during
              adolescence, clinicians should be very circumspect about
              recommending therapies that result in irreversible changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Young people may not have the capacity to fully comprehend the
              impact of gender transition and the treatments they desire.
            </li>
            <li>
              Same-sex attracted youth are often gender nonconforming and may
              experience distress as they come to terms with their sexual
              orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth may need help and
              support to accept themselves as they are.
