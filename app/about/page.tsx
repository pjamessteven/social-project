      <h1 className="">The story behind detrans.ai</h1>
      <p>
        On Tuesday the 23rd of September 2025, I launched the first version of
        detrans.ai, which allowed people to use deep-research to explore gender
        topics through a detrans lens. Since then I have been continually
        improving the site:
        <ol>
          <li>
            All the answers to questions that are asked in deep research mode are now
            stored and made visible to Google, other search engines, and
            hopefully to future AI models as they crawl the web for training
            data.

        Today it is Sunday the 2nd of November 2025, and after sitting with my
        thoughts for a while, I am publishing them.

        While I recognise that{" "}

        can provide relief for gender-distressed people, I strongly disagree
        with how it is the first and only treatment option available in most
        Western countries, and I am shocked at how difficult it is to find
        non-affirming therapists who might question <i>why</i> one feels like
        they're in the wrong body. In some places in the world this is even an
        illegal practice. This is due to cancel culture and how it has become
        taboo to question gender identities, as the curious belief that gender
        is innate and that people can be born in the wrong body has pervaded
        society (even though believers often claim that gender can also be
        'fluid'). The existence of detrans people and their stories debunks this
        myth, and I strongly disagree that promoting a lifetime of cross-sex
        hormones with dangerous side-effects and irreversible surgeries is
        rational when for many - if not all - people gender dysphoria has
        pathological roots. There is an acute lack of logic and reason in trans
        'healthcare', and this is causing serious harm to people!

        I am concerned about the recent surge in people being diagnosed with
        gender dysphoria. Since 2011, gender dysphoria diagnosises{" "}

        (5000%) in the UK. Young women are also now the overwhelming majority in
        these statistics, 3:1 female to male in the UK in 2019, when in the
        early 2000s, males outnumbered females 4:1. This represents one of the
        most dramatic demographic shifts in medical history. I really do believe
        that people are being influenced to adopt trans identity and transition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gender ideology is harmful to society in how it reinforces sexist
        stereotypes and roles. As an example, if a kid in school who does not
        display stereotypically masculine or feminine behaviours they may be
        seen as a 'trans kid' instead of just a gender non-confirming boy or
        girl, they will internalise the fact that adults and other kids who have
        been indoctrinated with gender ideology may percieve them to be
        'non-binary' aka, not a real girl/boy. By internalising this message and
        other signals from media and online communities they will experience
        self-doubt and distress, which will nudge them towards adopting
        transgender identities and subsequently into the unforgiving medical
        pipeline by misguided affirming doctors.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who beleive in gender ideology think that they are progressive
        and liberating themselves from sexist steretypes and roles, but in
        reality it's the opposite as they depend on sexist steretypes and roles
        in order to define themselves and others in the first place. Gender
        ideology is oppressive and directly at-odds with the original goals of
        feminism, but people who think for themselves and point this out are now
        labeled as evil TERFs. A good thought experiment is to consider
        non-binary identities, and why those exist today. If you're lazy,{" "}

        I now see clearly how cancel culture has permeated every level of
        society and every institution, how online echo chambers are affecting
        the information that people are receiving, and how social media provides
        endless affirmation and validation of people who are essentially in a

        , and sometimes men who have genuine predatory intentions, have entitled
        themselves to female-only spaces, such as changing rooms, prisons,
        sports competitions and even rape crisis centers, which is causing
        significant harm to women and eroding their sex-based rights. This is
        wrong and it needs to stop.

        Detransitioners say that trans communities can be cult like, as if
        believers (who may or may not be trans themselves) sense any sign of
        dissident, they will threaten to 'cancel' you and cut you off from your
        friends and community by labelling you as either a <i>'transphobe'</i>,{" "}
        <i>'never a real trans person'</i> or{" "}
        <i>'in denial, back in the closet'</i>, because it goes against their
        narrative that people are born this way. These are just coping
        mechanisms, really. <i>“Death before detransition”</i>, the cult chants.
        Society is in an abusive relationship with trans identities.

        Many people who identified as gay or straight at one point, come to a
        realisation that sexuality is not as black and white as society once
        told them it is. Those who identify as heterosexual or homosexual often
        stigmatise and delegitimise bisexual people - this is called bi-erasure.
        People with a bisexual history may be told by some gay and straight
        people that they are 'in the closet' because from their limited
        experiences of sexuality and attraction they simply can't understand.
        This is an opressive and cult-like tactic that can cause significant
        stress and trauma to an individual. It mirrors the experience that many
        detrans people have when trying to leave the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who promote and spread the lie that people 'can be born in the
        wrong body' or that they can be born 'gay' is extremely harmful. These
        lies are pseudoscience with no scientific backing and they limit human
        growth and potential. Gender dysphoria and same-sex attraction are very
        real phenomenons, but there is no evidence that either is innate, and
        the experiences of detransitioners and thos who have experienced their
        sexuality change over time are at direct odds with these beliefs. There
        are serious implications suggesting that these identities are innate and
        unchangeable. This belief system promotes and enforces hopelessness,
        lack of self-agency and despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that we can do better for people who are experiencing gender
        dysphoria. Instead of promoting lifetime medicalisation of people's
        bodies so that they better fit societies gendered expectations, I
        believe that through detrans perspectives we can help trans-identified
        people increase their self-awareness so that they can recognise that
        their desire to transition was likely not born from the existence of
        some kind of inner 'gender identity', but rather motivated by other
        underlying psychological issues that should be addressed. I think that
        one day we will look back at gender affirming care in horror, the same
        way we now look at how we used to give people lobotomies.

        explore the site.
