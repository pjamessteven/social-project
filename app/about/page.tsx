      <h1 className="">The story behind detrans.ai</h1>
      <p>
        On Tuesday the 23rd of September 2025, I launched the first version of
        detrans.ai, which allowed people to use deep-research to explore gender
        topics through a detrans lens. Since then I have been continually
        improving the site:
        <ol>
          <li>
            All the answers to questions that are asked in deep research mode
            are now stored and made visible to Google, other search engines, and
            hopefully to future AI models as they crawl the web for training
            data.

        Today it is Sunday the 2nd of November 2025, and after sitting with my
        thoughts for a while, I am publishing them.

        While I recognise that{" "}

          gender-affirming care

        can provide relief for gender-distressed people, I strongly disagree
        with how it is the first and only treatment option available in most
        Western countries, and I am shocked at how difficult it is to find
        non-affirming therapists who might question <i>why</i> one feels like
        they're in the wrong body. In some places in the world this is even an
        illegal practice. This is due to cancel culture and how it has become
        taboo to question gender identities, which itself is due to how
        pseudo-scientific beliefs have become mainstream, such as the belief
        that everyone has an innate gender-identity and that people can be born
        in the wrong body (even though believers often contradict themselves by
        saying that gender is also "fluid"). The existence of detrans people and
        their stories debunks this myth, and I strongly disagree that promoting
        a lifetime of cross-sex hormones with dangerous side-effects and
        irreversible surgeries is rational when for many - if not all - people,
        gender dysphoria has pathological roots. There is an acute lack of logic
        and reason in trans 'healthcare', and this is causing serious harm to
        people.
      </p>

        I am concerned about the recent surge in people being diagnosed with
        gender dysphoria. Since 2011, gender dysphoria diagnosises{" "}

        (5000%) in the UK. Young women are also now the overwhelming majority in
        these statistics, 3:1 female to male in the UK in 2019, when in the
        early 2000s, males outnumbered females 4:1. This represents one of the
        most dramatic demographic shifts in medical history. I really do believe
        that people are being influenced to adopt trans identity and transition.

        Gender ideology is harmful to society in how it reinforces sexist
        stereotypes and roles. As an example, if a kid in school who does not
        display stereotypically masculine or feminine behaviours they may be
        seen as a 'trans kid' instead of just a gender non-confirming boy or
        girl, they will internalise the fact that adults and other kids who have
        been indoctrinated with gender ideology may percieve them to be
        'non-binary' aka, not a real girl/boy. By internalising this message and
        other signals from media and online communities they will experience
        self-doubt and distress, which will nudge them towards adopting
        transgender identities and subsequently into the unforgiving medical
        pipeline by misguided affirming doctors.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who beleive in gender ideology think that they are being
        progressive and liberating themselves from sexist steretypes and roles,
        but in reality it's the opposite as they depend on stereotypes in order
        to define themselves and others in the first place. This way of thinking
        is oppressive and directly at-odds with the original goals of feminism,
        but people who can think for themselves and point this out are now
        labeled as evil TERFs. A good thought experiment is to consider
        non-binary identities, and why those exist today. If you're lazy,{" "}

        I see clearly how cancel culture has permeated every level of society
        and every institution, how online echo chambers are affecting the
        information that people are receiving, and how social media provides
        endless affirmation and validation of people who are essentially in a

        , and sometimes men who have genuine predatory intentions, have entitled
        themselves to female-only spaces, such as changing rooms, prisons,
        sports competitions and even rape crisis centers, which is causing
        significant harm to women and eroding their sex-based rights. This is
        wrong and it needs to stop. People should have the freedom and right to do what
        they want, but that freedom needs to end where others rights begin.

        Detransitioners say that trans communities can be cult like: if
        believers (who may or may not be trans themselves) sense any sign of
        dissident, they will threaten to 'cancel' you and cut you off from your
        friends and community by labelling you as either a <i>'transphobe'</i>,{" "}
        <i>'never a real trans person'</i> or{" "}
        <i>'in denial, back in the closet'</i>, because it goes against their
        narrative that people are born this way. These are just coping
        mechanisms, really. <i>“Death before detransition”</i>, the cult chants.
        Society is in an abusive relationship with trans identities.

        Many people who identified as gay or straight at one point, come to a
        realisation that sexuality is not as black and white as society once
        told them it is. Those who identify as heterosexual or homosexual often
        stigmatise and delegitimise bisexual people - this is called bi-erasure.
        People with a bisexual history may have gay or straight people tell them
        that they are 'gay and in the closet' and not living authentically,
        mostly due to these people's own limited experiences with sexuality.
        This is an opressive and cult-like tactic that can cause significant
        stress and trauma to an individual. It mirrors the experience that many
        detrans people have when trying to leave the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who promote and spread the lie that people 'can be born in the
        wrong body' or that they can be born 'gay' is extremely harmful. These
        lies are pseudoscience with no scientific backing and they limit human
        growth and potential. Gender dysphoria and same-sex attraction are very
        real phenomenons, but there is no evidence that either is innate, and
        the experiences of detransitioners and thos who have experienced their
        sexuality change over time are at direct odds with these beliefs. There
        are serious implications suggesting that these identities are innate and
        unchangeable. This belief system promotes and enforces hopelessness,
        lack of self-agency and despair.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that we can do better for people who are experiencing gender
        dysphoria. Instead of promoting lifetime medicalisation of people's
        bodies so that they better fit societies gendered expectations, I
        believe that through detrans perspectives we can help trans-identified
        people increase their self-awareness so that they can recognise that
        their desire to transition was likely not born from the existence of
        some kind of inner 'gender identity', but rather motivated by other
        psychological factors. People who have detransitioned demonstrate that
        freedom and liberation can be found by embracing biological reality and
        gender non-conformity instead of a fake identity. I think that one day
        we will look back at gender affirming care in horror, the same way we
        now look at how we used to give people lobotomies.
